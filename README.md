# Cassava Disease Type Detector

Welcome to the Cassava Disease Type Detector project! This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze photos of cassava leaves and determine the type of disease present. It's built using React and Vite for efficient development and deployment.

## Features

- **Disease Type Detection:** The main functionality of this project is to identify the type of disease affecting cassava plants based on uploaded leaf photos.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily upload photos and receive prompt feedback on the type of disease detected.
- **Fast Processing:** Leveraging machine learning models, the analysis process is fast and efficient, providing quick results to users.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms for image analysis and disease type detection.
